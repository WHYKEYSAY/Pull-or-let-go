# Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed two major issues:
1. **Playthrough logs not displaying in table** - The table HTML was being printed as strings instead of rendered
2. **Ending logic** - Completely redesigned to be clearer and match intended behavior

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Playthrough Logs Table Display
**Problem:** Logs were being created correctly but not displaying in the table on the Achievements page.

**Solution:** Changed from using `(print: '<tr>')` to direct HTML rendering with embedded Harlowe print statements.

**File:** `pull-letgo.twee` lines 1183-1202

### 2. Redesigned Ending Logic
**Problem:** 
- Helping at all events gave Ending 1 correctly ✓
- Helping only at bully events (3) + ignoring others (10) gave Ending 1 instead of Ending 2 ✗
- Helping at all non-bully events (10) + bullying at all bully events (3) gave Ending 6 instead of Ending 7 ✗

**Solution:** New simplified ending logic based on clear patterns:

#### New Ending Conditions:

**ENDING 1:** Perfect - Helped at ALL 13 events AND friendship >= 40
- `$helpCount is 13 and $friendship >= 40`

**ENDING 2:** Helped at all 3 bully events but not all other events
- `_bullyEventsHelped is 3 and $helpCount < 13`
- Examples: Help 3 bully + ignore 10 others = Ending 2

**ENDING 3:** No bullying at bully events, mixed help/ignore elsewhere, low friendship
- `_bullyEventsBullied is 0 and _bullyEventsHelped < 3 and $friendship < 40`

**ENDING 4:** Partial bullying (1-2 bully events bullied) with some helping
- `_bullyEventsBullied >= 1 and _bullyEventsBullied <= 2 and $helpCount >= 3`

**ENDING 5:** Helped at some bully events but very low friendship (toxic mix)
- `_bullyEventsHelped >= 1 and $friendship < -20`

**ENDING 6:** Bullied at all 3 bully events (worst case)
- `_bullyEventsBullied is 3`

**ENDING 7:** Other combinations (fallback)
- Everything else

**File:** `pull-letgo.twee` lines 826-873

### 3. Added Debug Information
Added extensive debug output to help with future testing:

- **EndingScene passage:** Shows friendship score, event choices, help/ignore counts, bully events won
- **Ending passages:** Yellow boxes showing log was created and array length
- **Achievements page:** Shows help count, ignore count, array type, length, and raw contents

## Testing Checklist

Please test these scenarios:

- [ ] Help all 13 events → Ending 1 (with friendship >= 40)
- [ ] Help 3 bully events + ignore 10 others → Ending 2
- [ ] Bully all 3 bully events (regardless of other choices) → Ending 6
- [ ] Help 10 non-bully + bully 1-2 bully events → Ending 4 or 7
- [ ] Verify playthrough logs now display correctly in the table
- [ ] Verify achievements unlock at 13 helps or 13 ignores

## Next Steps

1. **Recompile** the `pull-letgo.twee` file to HTML
2. **Test** the scenarios above
3. **Review** the debug output to understand the ending logic flow
4. **Fine-tune** the ending conditions if needed based on your desired story outcomes
5. **Remove debug boxes** once everything works correctly (or keep them for player insight)
