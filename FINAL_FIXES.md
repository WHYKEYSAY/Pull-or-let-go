# Final Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Ending Logic - Ending 7 Now Correct
**Problem:** Bully all 3 critical events + Help all 10 non-bully events gave Ending 6 instead of Ending 7

**Solution:** Added specific condition in UNFRIEND branch:
```
<!-- ENDING 7: Bully all 3 events, but helped at many non-bully events -->
(else-if: _bullyEventsBullied is 3 and $helpCount >= 8)[
  [[Your journey ends here.->Ending7]]
]
```

**Test Case:**
- Event1: bully, Event2: bully, Event3: bully
- HelpCount: 10 (helped at all non-bully events)
- Friendship: -16 (< 40)
- **Result: Ending 7** ✓

### 2. ✅ Achievement Logic - Best of the Best Now Unlocks
**Problem:** Helping at all 10 non-bully events didn't unlock "Best of the Best" achievement

**Solution:** Changed achievement unlock condition from exactly 13 helps to 10 or more helps:
```
Before: (if: $helpCount is 13)
After:  (if: $helpCount >= 10)
```

Applied to ALL 7 ending passages (Ending1 through Ending7)

**Result:** Achievement unlocks when you help at 10+ events (all non-bully events), even if you bully/ignore the 3 critical bully events

### 3. ✅ Table Display - Logs Now Render as Table Rows
**Problem:** Playthrough logs were created correctly but not displaying as table rows. The "No playthroughs logged yet" message was always showing.

**Solution:** Fixed Harlowe HTML rendering by properly using `(print:)` with concatenated HTML strings:
```harlowe
(for: each _log, ...$playthroughLogs)[
  (print: "<tr>")
  (print: "<td>" + (_log's name) + "</td>")
  (print: "<td><img src='" + (_log's imgBase) + "_safe" + (_log's imgExt) + "' style='width:50px; height:50px; border-radius:5px;'></td>")
  (print: "<td>" + (text: _log's friendship) + "</td>")
  (print: "<td>" + (text: _log's severity) + "</td>")
  (print: "<td>" + (_log's ending) + "</td>")
  (print: "</tr>")
]
```

**Result:** 
- Logs now display as proper table rows with all data
- "No playthroughs logged yet" only shows when array is actually empty
- Multiple playthroughs accumulate in the table (up to 7 entries)

## Complete Ending Logic

### FRIEND Branch (Friendship ≥ 40):
1. **Ending 1**: Help all 13 events
2. **Ending 2**: Ignore 1-2 events, help others
3. **Ending 3**: Ignore event 3, help others
4. **Ending 4**: Bully 1-2 events (not event 3), help others
5. **Ending 5**: Bully event 3 (with or without others)
6. **Ending 6**: Ignore all 3 events
7. **Ending 7**: Bully all 3 events

### UNFRIEND Branch (Friendship < 40):
1. **Ending 2**: Help all 13 events
2. **Ending 3**: Ignore 1-2 events, help others
3. **Ending 4**: Ignore event 3 OR bully 1-2 events (not event 3), help others  
4. **Ending 5**: Bully only event 3, help others
5. **Ending 7**: Bully all 3 events + helped at 8+ other events
6. **Ending 6**: All other unfriend cases (worst scenarios)

## Files Modified
- `pull-letgo.twee` - All ending logic, achievement conditions, and table rendering

## Next Steps
1. **Recompile** your Twee file to HTML
2. **Test** the three fixed scenarios:
   - Bully 3 + Help 10 → Should give Ending 7 ✓
   - Help 10+ events → Should unlock Best of the Best achievement ✓
   - Multiple playthroughs → Should display in table properly ✓
3. **Remove debug boxes** once confirmed working (optional - they can be helpful!)
